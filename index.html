    <h1>My name is Alyna</h1>
    <p>I'm a rising senior in high school. I was first introduced to coding in middle school and have been passionate about it ever since. Similarly, I've always been drawn to video games as well as creative hobbies. As such, I aspire to be a video game developer in the future. Its the perfect combination of my love for gaming, coding, and creativity!
